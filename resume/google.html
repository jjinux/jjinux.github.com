              <li>
                Gave talks about Dart.
  
                Gave 7 international talks in 6 countries.
  
                Gave 9 talks locally.
  
              <li>
                Wrote open source code.
  
                Developed
                <a href="https://github.com/jjinux/doc-code-merge">doc-code-merge</a>
                and led development of
                <a href="https://github.com/jjinux/doc-code-verify">doc-code-verify</a>
                to make sure code samples embedded in documentation stay correct.
  
                Led a project called
                <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2013/01/more-dart-html5-goodness.html">dart-html5-samples</a>
                to port samples from HTML5 Rocks into Dart. The samples are linked
                to from the welcome page of Dart Editor.
  
                Worked with another developer to build a project called
                <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2013/03/irrduino-sprinkler-system-built-using.html">Irrduino</a>.
                The frontend that I built in Dart looks like Farmville, but it
                actually controls a real sprinkler system.
  
                Built <a href="https://github.com/jjinux/tetris-in-dart">Tetris in Dart</a>
                only a month after Dart was first announced.

                just those 7 episodes.

                resulted in 1.8k views and 166 hours of watch time. This took a
                lot of effort since I am not a native Spanish speaker!
  
                Created a screencast on using
                <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2013/02/dart-with-google-web-toolkit.html">Dart with GWT</a> that got 1.7k views and 161 hours of watch time.

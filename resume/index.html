              Gave talks about Dart.

              Gave 7 international talks in 6 countries.

              Gave 9 talks locally.

            <li>
              Wrote open source code.

              Developed
              <a href="https://github.com/financeCoding/doc-code-merge">doc-code-merge</a>

              <a href="https://github.com/financeCoding/doc-code-verify">doc-code-verify</a>
              to make sure code samples embedded in documentation stay correct.

              Led a project called
              <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2013/01/more-dart-html5-goodness.html">dart-html5-samples</a>
              to port samples from HTML5 Rocks into Dart. The samples are linked

              Worked with another developer to build a project called
              <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2013/03/irrduino-sprinkler-system-built-using.html">Irrduino</a>.
              The frontend that I built in Dart looks like Farmville, but it
              actually controls a real sprinkler system.

              Built <a href="https://github.com/jjinux/tetris-in-dart">Tetris in Dart</a>
              only a month after Dart was first announced.

            <li>
              Advocated for Dart using video.

              Hosted or helped host 7 episodes of
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIS2zgjdmBEwTrA6m5YgHBs">Dartisans</a>
              for Google Developers Live. We've gotten over 11k views for
              just those 7 episodes.

              Gave a talk on Dart <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=YdzSdWUkA5s">in Spanish</a> that
              resulted in 1.8k views and 166 hours of watch time. This took a
              lot of effort since I am not a native Spanish speaker!

              Created a screencast on using
              <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2013/02/dart-with-google-web-toolkit.html">Dart with GWT</a> that got 1.7k views and 161 hours of watch time.

              Spoke remotely at 3 DevFests for a total of 300 attendees.

            <li>

              Jarek Wilkiewicz and I decreased the average customer wait
              time for the partner support queue by 300% in one quarter.
              Worked with Jarek Wilkiewicz to gain a total of 10 commitments
              for various YouTube API launches. In particular, worked with 6
              different partners as they integrated with
              <a href="http://youtube.com/create">YouTube.com/create</a>.
              Had 56 partner meetings in which I solved problems, gathered
              feedback, and garnered integrations.
              
            <li>
              Gave two webinars for Google I/O. My webinar
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XstD6_c3hj0">Using Ruby on Rails and YouTube APIs for Educational Apps</a>
              currently has 75k views and was our most successful Google Developers Live
              video. My webinar 
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch1LrOdKbWY">YouTube for Your Business</a>
              currently has 13k views.

            <li>
              Built <a href="https://github.com/jjinux/quizzimoto">Quizzimoto</a>,
              an open source application that I used as the basis for
              my talk
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XstD6_c3hj0">Using Ruby on Rails and YouTube APIs for Educational Apps</a>
              talk.  Also used it to give a talk at two local Ruby users
              groups, including a talk at Pivotal Labs.

            <li>
              Worked with Jeffrey Posnick to build
              <a href="http://github.com/jjinux/party-playlist-picker">Party Playlist Picker</a>.
              It's an open source Google App Engine application written in
              Python that lets users collaboratively edit a YouTube playlist
              in realtime. Our
              <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGWAiAfmrhc">Google Developers Live</a> video for it has
              gotten over 1k views. My team members liked the way I
              structured the code so much that they used the same structure
              in their other Python applications.

            <li>
              Provided technical support for business development in
              meetings with game publishers. I've met with roughly 15
              partners including one of Google's largest advertising partners.
              This had a direct impact on Google's bottom line.

            <li>    
              Open sourced numerous sample projects written in
              <a href="http://github.com/jjinux/party-playlist-picker">Python</a>,
              <a href="https://github.com/jjinux/quizzimoto">Ruby</a>,

            <li>
              In the last year, I've written 61 technical blog posts on my
              <a href="http://jjinux.blogspot.com">personal blog</a>. I get
              10k page views a month. I have 1k subscribers on Google
              Reader, but I'm also aggregated into Python Planet which has 4.3k
              subscribers on Google Reader. I have 5.4k followers on G+ as of
